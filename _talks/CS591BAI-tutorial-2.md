In this section, we explore neuron-level interpretability by introducing a biologically plausible neural model — the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) — illustrating how the incorporation of temporal dynamics enhances the expressiveness of individual neurons, and highlighting the delicate balance between biological plausibility and computational efficiency that enables the scalability of spiking neurons in large language models.
