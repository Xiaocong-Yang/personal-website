title: "Modular Network Training via Adjoint Structure Predictor"
collection: publications
category: ongoing
excerpt: 'Learn the LLM’s computational topology instead of hand-engineering it: We propose a structure predictor adjoint to a LLM, which generates a context-dependent computational graph applied to the LLM. This allows the modular structure to emerge with minimal contraints during training.'
