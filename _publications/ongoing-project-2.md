title: "IIT-Based Event-Driven Memory for Self-Evolving Large Language Model Agents"
collection: publications
category: ongoing
excerpt: 'Memory is central to autonomous, self-evolving agents. Leveraging Integrated Information Theory (IIT), we design time-variant memory that integrates past experience via event-driven updates gated by reward, effectively treating consolidation as learning in a standard RL framework.'
